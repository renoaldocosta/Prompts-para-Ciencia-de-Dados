    "Texto": "\n\nThe UK is establishing the Laboratory for AI Security Research (LASR) to help protect Britain and its allies against emerging threats in what officials describe as an “AI arms race.”\nThe laboratory – which will receive an initial government funding of £8.22 million – aims to bring together experts from industry, academia, and government to assess AI’s impact on national security. The announcement comes as part of a broader strategy to strengthen the UK’s cyber defence capabilities.\nSpeaking at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference at Lancaster House, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said: “NATO needs to continue to adapt to the world of AI, because as the tech evolves, the threat evolves.\n“NATO has stayed relevant over the last seven decades by constantly adapting to new threats. It has navigated the worlds of nuclear proliferation and militant nationalism. The move from cold warfare to drone warfare.”\nThe Chancellor painted a stark picture of the current cyber security landscape, stating: “Cyber war is now a daily reality. One where our defences are constantly being tested. The extent of the threat must be matched by the strength of our resolve to combat it and to protect our citizens and systems.”\nThe new laboratory will operate under a ‘catalytic’ model, designed to attract additional investment and collaboration from industry partners.\nKey stakeholders in the new lab include GCHQ, the National Cyber Security Centre, the MOD’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, and prestigious academic institutions such as the University of Oxford and Queen’s University Belfast.\nIn a direct warning about Russia’s activities, the Chancellor declared: “Be in no doubt: the United Kingdom and others in this room are watching Russia. We know exactly what they are doing, and we are countering their attacks both publicly and behind the scenes.\n“We know from history that appeasing dictators engaged in aggression against their neighbours only encourages them. Britain learned long ago the importance of standing strong in the face of such actions.”\nReaffirming support for Ukraine, he added, “Putin is a man who wants destruction, not peace. He is trying to deter our support for Ukraine with his threats. He will not be successful.”\nThe new lab follows recent concerns about state actors using AI to bolster existing security threats.\n“Last year, we saw the US for the first time publicly call out a state for using AI to aid its malicious cyber activity,” the Chancellor noted, referring to North Korea’s attempts to use AI for malware development and vulnerability scanning.\nStephen Doughty, Minister for Europe, North America and UK Overseas Territories, highlighted the dual nature of AI technology: “AI has enormous potential. To ensure it remains a force for good in the world, we need to understand its threats and its opportunities.”\nAlongside LASR, the government announced a new £1 million incident response project to enhance collaborative cyber defence capabilities among allies. The laboratory will prioritise collaboration with Five Eyes countries and NATO allies, building on the UK’s historical strength in computing, dating back to Alan Turing’s groundbreaking work.\nThe initiative forms part of the government’s comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, which includes the upcoming Cyber Security and Resilience Bill and the recent classification of data centres as critical national infrastructure"
