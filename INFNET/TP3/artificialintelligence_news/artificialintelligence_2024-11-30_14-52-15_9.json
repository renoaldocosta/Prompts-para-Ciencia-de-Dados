    "Texto": "\n\nSamsung has revealed Gauss2, the second-generation proprietary AI model set to significantly enhance user experiences.\nPaul Kyungwhoon Cheun, President and CTO of the Device eXperience (DX) Division, commented: “Samsung Electronics is committed to developing cutting-edge software, including AI and data analytics, to enhance user experiences.\n“With three distinct models, Samsung Gauss2 is already boosting our internal productivity, and we plan to integrate it into products to deliver higher levels of convenience and personalisation.”\nSamsung Gauss2: Multimodal AI\nGauss2 builds upon last year’s internal generative AI model, showcasing advancements in handling language, code, and images. It comes in three variants: Compact, Balanced, and Supreme, tailored to different computational needs.\n\nCompact: Optimised for environments with limited computing resources, ensuring effective performance even on-device.\nBalanced: Strikes a balance among performance, speed, and efficiency; suitable for a variety of tasks.\nSupreme: Incorporates Mixture of Experts (MoE) technology to minimise computational costs while maximising efficiency and performance.\n\nGauss2 is designed to support between nine and fourteen languages, depending on the model, and a range of programming languages.\nSamsung’s custom training techniques and tokeniser aim to deliver peak efficiency across supported languages. The new models promise response generation speeds 1.5 to 3 times faster than leading open-source alternatives, facilitating prompt AI interaction and minimising wait times.\nCustomisation and deployment\nSamsung’s in-house generative AI model allows easier customisation for specific applications.\nGauss2 supports diverse productivity tasks, with widespread adoption among Samsung developers. The coding assistant ‘code.i’ – enhanced by Gauss2 – is utilised extensively within the DX Division and by international research teams, with up to 60% of developers now engaging regularly.\nThe Gauss Portal, another Gauss-powered AI service, enhances productivity through features such as document summarisation and translation. Since its launch, this AI service has expanded internationally, aiding various office tasks. As of August, call centre operations also benefit from AI-driven categorisation and summarisation.\n\nGoing forward, Samsung aims to further boost internal productivity, improving services like code.i and enhancing the Gauss Portal’s natural language question-and-answer capabilities. Future functionalities will include multimodal operations, like chart analysis and image creation.\n‘AI for All’\nSamsung’s strategy, “AI for All,” envisions widespread incorporation of AI-based services across its product lines. By combining AI with knowledge graph technology, Samsung anticipates delivering even greater personalisation.\nBesides Gauss2, the conference featured presentations on software development, including the SmartThings platform’s customer experience improvements.\nAttendees engaged in 29 technical sessions covering:\n\nThe future of healthcare developments within Samsung’s health ecosystem.\nEnhancements in the SmartThings experience through generative AI.\nInsights into the code.i AI coding assistant.\nLifestyle content innovations for TV.\nAI solutions for Samsung’s home appliances.\n\nSDC24 Korea underscored Samsung’s vision to integrate AI across its ecosystem.\n(Image Credit: Samsung)"
